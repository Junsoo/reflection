Q. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A. It helps user to realize that which line has been modified. In a long documnents with large amount of lines, it is useful when you know where to look at to find the difference. 

Q. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A. Like reviewing chess helps understand why every move has been made, reviewing the process of how the document (or coding) has been made helps understand why the original programmer choose to do so. 

Q. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A. Pros : You can commit or save in reasonable size. Cons : You might forget to commit and lose the changes you made. 

Q. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A. It depends on how those files are related. If one file effects heavily in to another file, it is reasonable to track those changes for sakes of all of the files. 

Q. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A. git log shows commit log and git diff shows differences of two selected commits. 'git log' and 'git diff first_id second_id'


Q. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?


A. I know now I can fix mistakes that I make! 

Q. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A. To learn more about git and git hub in order to build a billion dollar company!!
