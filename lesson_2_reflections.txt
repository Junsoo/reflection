Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. .git file will be created. .git tracks every commits in the repository and make sure we can utilize out of it. 

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. Well, this is a bit tricky. I understand that staging area helps to determine the files that need to be included in the specific commits. But, it seems to be not convenient to do this everytime I make changes.
